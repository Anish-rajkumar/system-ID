# system-ID on active suspension system
# Using PAA (parameter adaptation algorithm)
The main objective of this project was to identify the controller parameters for an active suspension system of a quarter car model with the help of parameter adaptation algorithm (PAA) using recursive least square algorithm method with forgetting factor. The suspension system of an automobile is rated based on different characteristics like passenger comfort and stability of the vehicle based on ride quality and also handling of the vehicle. In this project the feasibility of parameter adaptation algorithm (PAA) was conducted by starting off with the initial estimation of the parameters which would get updated online and would finally reach the true state dynamic parameter of the plant. The true state parameters of the active suspension system are determined using the dynamic modeling of the system and with the help of dynamic model z-domain transfer function of the system was determined which contained the controller parameters of the plant. The parameter adaptation algorithm was conducted using MATLAB in order to achieve the estimation of true dynamic parameters for an active suspension system of a quarter car model
